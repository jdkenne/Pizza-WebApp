# Pizza-WebApp


This flask application was delpoyed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

It utilizes a MySQL backend to manipulate and format the data, while the front end allows for front facing changes to be made and presented in a format that is readable and understandable by the viewer. 


For formatting, a combination of HTML and CSS were used to create a visual site that accounts for accessibility and for a combination of colors that are visually appealing to users.


To get this started, download the files and make sure to create a virtual environment within the folder this project was downloaded to. When complete, run 
'python3 application.py' and copy/paste the url it gives you into a browser and you're good to go!
